About
------
I am a 3rd year graduate student in linguistics and computer science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The majority of my work is focused on the question of what knowledge a learner must have a priori in order to acquire language ? applying methodologies from NLP and machine learning to determine which linguistic information/structures can be acquired by a purely statistical learner and which may need to be accounted for by built in biases.
