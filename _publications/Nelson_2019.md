This paper presents a model that treats segmentation and underlying representation acquisition as parallel, interacting processes. A probability distribution over mappings from underlying to surface representations is defined using a Maximum Entropy grammar which weights a set of underlying representation constraints (URCs) (Apoussidou, 2007; Pater et al., 2012). URCs are induced from observed surface strings and used to generate candidates. Structural ambiguity arising from the comparison of segmented outputs to unsegmented surface strings is handled with Expectation Maximization (Dempster et al., 1977; Jarosz, 2013). The model successfully learns a simple voicing assimilation rule and segmentation via correspondences between surface phones and input meanings. The trained grammar is also able to segment novel forms affixed with familiar morphemes.
